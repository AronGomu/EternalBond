    tob "You'll see for yourself pal, Yomall is a nice place."

    tob "Nothing to do but the landscape is gorgeous, and so are the women."

    tob "But hey...{w} No way to export them."

    me "The curse ?"

    tob "Yup, they won't leave the place."
    
    tob "It's not their fault though."
    
    tob "They can't."

    tob "..."

    tob "I've experienced that myself..."

    me "Did you know about the curse before going to Yomall ?"
    
    tob "Sort of."

    tob "There were rumours about a city so utopian nobody leaved."

    tob "But I didn't know the specifities."

    me "I see."

    me "And then you learned all that."

    tob "Not much actually."

    tob "All I know is that a obscure force change the minds of people."

    tob "Also you start forgetting memories made outside the city."

    tob "And that the process is kinda slow."

    tob "You really start to feel it after 1 or 2 month."

    tob "After that, it's just some hypothesis."

    me "How did you stay you said ?"

    tob "Half a year."

    tob "But I was more resistant than the average I think."

    tob "I only lost my memories about my childhood."

    tob "But If I stayed 1 or 2 more weeks, I don't know if I could leave."

    me "And how long did she stayed ?"

    tob "Sylvia ?"

    tob "She arrived 4 or 5 months before me."

    tob "By the way, if you think about going there."

    tob "Try to get some news about her."

    tob "I would like to know how she's doing."

    me "Why didn't you force her to come with you ?"

    tob "It's a curse Fynn."

    tob "And she was totally corrupted."

    tob "I didn't want to take any risks."

    me "Risks ?"

    tob "What if she gets killed for leaving ?"

    tob "Or try to go back anyway, even if it meant dying ?"

    tob "I..."

    me "No you're right."

    "..."

    tob "Still want to go there ?"

    me "I do but first, I have business to attend to."

    tob "Do you really want to take the risk ?"

    me "There are no risk."

    me "At worst, I outlive the curse."

    me "At best I resolve the case."

    tob "Ok then listen."

    tob "Don't ever tell my name there."

    tob "Act like you don't know me alright ?"

    me "Is it about Sylvia ?"

    tob "Not really, I caused some ruckus during my stay there."

    tob "You should not pay the price for it."

    me "Understood."

    "..."

    tob "Wanna drink ?"
