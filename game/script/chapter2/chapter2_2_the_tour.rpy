    "If we didn't stop at each point of interest, it would only take about half an hour to make one lap around the walls."

    "It's also quite a new city."

    "It has been founded only about 200 years ago which is quite strange."

    "But that would explain why I didn't hear about it before."

    "But the stranger thing is..."

    "Why would nobody already settled in this region ?"

    "There is plenty of natural ressources, the weather is fine and there is water."

    "There are no logic reasons."

    "Unless for a curse."

    "That means that passing travellers aren't concerned by this."
